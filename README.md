[Robot Face](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/u1JXH6Lgcz6-rp2W6Gsf4B2uH_vJkY-MSrhOWpYTJrg)
> In this project I used shapes, and randomness to express my creativity and created a random robot face

[Captioned Scenes](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/XfaToWpOVcPc63IJRH6MLnXrizkbsTCyojkznQNAgDk)
> A creative project of this unit.  Using problem-solving process as a model.

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/PYLb8Jtpw1HajZW7C_SXxlayLLvF1_6chXG9ba1Ux6A)
> In this project I worked with a partner to create sprites that would move and respond to the correct inputs.  As well as use variables to help the sprites.

[Side Scroll Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/xocypBSy1Ham8hivhB9SVSOZ_MpwyDTa95B3dhLEg1Q)
