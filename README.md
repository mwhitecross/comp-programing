### Code.org Gamelab
[Robot Face](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/u1JXH6Lgcz6-rp2W6Gsf4B2uH_vJkY-MSrhOWpYTJrg)
> In this project I used shapes, and randomness to express my creativity and created a random robot face

[Captioned Scenes](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/XfaToWpOVcPc63IJRH6MLnXrizkbsTCyojkznQNAgDk)
> A creative project of this unit.  Using problem-solving process as a model.

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/PYLb8Jtpw1HajZW7C_SXxlayLLvF1_6chXG9ba1Ux6A)
> In this project I worked with a partner to create sprites that would move and respond to the correct inputs.  As well as use variables to help the sprites.

[Side Scroll Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/xocypBSy1Ham8hivhB9SVSOZ_MpwyDTa95B3dhLEg1Q)
> In this project I used code to create a game where the sprite jumps over obstacles and gets the target using the correct imputs.

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/KtDxohGznyY-oDvxOpt1BoJpwpuwqIT0-L4s9DtD-gM)
> In this project I used code to make moving platforms that would get in the way of the player.  

[Platform Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/MbH1cIy7GW5HA0N38grcWWWZs1BmIDZpUsGbosoBH0E)
> In this project I used code to allow a sprite to jump from platforms in order to collect more points while avoiding obstacles.

[Final Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/lcpx_NumwzxTBuWeqCn5H1xgi-Rd2ES6fh9lbdEq7GA)
> In this project I used code to make two diffrerent sprites use collisions and variable to keep score of how it is going.

### MIT App Inventor
[Hello Its Me](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=c2bc1947-49c5-495b-9078-d6bd9c1cb3c8)
> In this project I used buttons that would play sounds with code.

[Piano Maker](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=e27be818-1f96-4417-bc0a-f76b3af533c5)
> In this project I used butttons and code to make a piano.

[Music Maker](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=1b898f41-c48d-4114-a734-29e7c7216147)
> In this project I used buttons that when clicked would play sounds, and there was also buttons to record sound as well as play the recordings.

[Find The Gold](https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/#5277856869253120)
> In this project I used code to enable the ball to move towards the gold.  I also coded in that if the ball hit a wall it would have to restart.

[Food Chase](https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/#5556466035326976)
> In this project I used code to make  a ball fling towards sprites in order to grow and when a different colored ball hits the first one it ends the game.

### CS Academy
[Unit 1 Creative Task](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/chocolateCat1815)
>  In this project I used code to draw shapes and labels in order to create a logo.

[Unit 2 Creative Task](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/khakiBear6766)
>  In this project I used code to draw an object that can be modified through using code with a mouse click.
